Yipnyap Scalebite is a first-party app that allows ID-verified artists to create free E-commerce sites for commissions 
and merchandise made by them. Scalebite is planned to be 100% free.

## Free storage, $0. yuppp.
Get 100GB for free, then just $0.30/gb a month after that. Oh yeah, best part? Public high quality files don't count
towards your quota, but original uncompressed files do.

## Pay via Scalebite
Scalebite is **planned** to manage transactions the following way. If you have questions or suggestions, poke me on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rekkisomo) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/5RcrVRn)!

1. Buyer requests an item, and sent to Stripe to complete the purchase flow.
2. The transaction is marked as pending, and is not taken out of the Buyer's account.
3. Seller confirms the item is in stock, and the pending hold is confirmed and sent to the Seller's Scalebite Wallet.
4. The Seller must inform the Buyer of any updates. These change based on the category of the item:
    - For Commissions, the Seller must send updates to the Buyer every week.
      - **There's a special case where the Seller can avoid these rules** if they are a registered business. If their 
        request to bypass these rules are approved, they are able to use Stripe or PayPal directly instead of going 
        through Scalebite, and all current and future Buyers are notified about this exception before the purchase flow
        has begun, that Scalebite cannot provide guarantee and must go through Stripe or PayPal's dispute flow or their
        Bank if any issues occur.
          - The Seller can lose this exception if too many issues occur with multiple Buyers.
          - The Seller may be forced onto this exception if the item is R18 (UK) content. In extreme circumstances,
            they may have their account banned indefinitely and escalated to The Ministry of Justice if their content
            falls under the
            [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 c 4 (UK)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/part/5/crossheading/pornography-etc).
      - If an **update is missed more than twice in a row**, the Buyer will gain the ability to require their order to
        be prioritised to Yipnyap. If confirmed, the Buyer must send an update as soon as possible. If an update is
        **not received** after the prioritisation request is approved, Yipnyap will investigate further with the Seller.
        (See below)
      - If the order is **not finished within 365 days,** Scalebite will automatically take out up to 80% of the paid
        amount from the Seller's Scalebite Wallet, based on what the Seller has set their Automatic Dispute Settings to:
        - If the Seller has set it to Weekly Refund, every week after the 365 days is up, 5% will be taken out and
            put into the Buyer's Scalebite Wallet. If the order is finished before 80% total has been refunded, the
            Seller could request those funds back from the Buyer, within reason.
5. The Seller completes the order, and marks it as such, then the Buyer is asked to confirm this. If the Buyer marks it
as incomplete, the order will be investigated further. If the order has been completed, and the Buyer has done this more
than once on multiple orders, they could be suspended from Scalebite's Purchase Flow.
  - If the Buyer is suspended while a current order exists, those Sellers will be notified instantly and can choose to
    either cancel the order or continue through Scalebite or through Stripe or PayPal instead.
