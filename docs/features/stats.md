:::note Everyone is opted-out of this by default
To opt-in, go to `⚙Settings > 👥Social Wellbeing > 🐾Paws`. You can opt-out at any time. Your original
Follower/Following/Friend count does not change in these processes.
:::

Follower counts shifts the focus away from user content, and instead creates an odd experience in a community. Seeing
someone new follow you makes you feel great, while seeing someone unfollow you hurts, it could create a weird
conversation, or change your view on someone. If you see a post from someone and they have minimal followers, their
content could become questionable of OC or quality. There's also the issue of someone may have many followers, but not
having an engaging audience, creating a false idea on the user.

## Paws
To circumvent this, Yipnyap has a system called 🐾 Paws. It's a point system that grows based on the total number
of likes, replies, and followers. It will decline based on your activity, meaning if you're inactive, you will slowly
lose Paws (only up to 🐾50). You can still lose Paws based on unfollows, however they **do not update immediately**, so
if someone unfollows you, but then someone else at around the same time likes your post, the number won't go down.

## Friends
There will be a number called "Friends", which will show how many mutual followers a user has, how many friends
they have on Yipnyap. This number is different to Paws, as Mutual Followers **do not** add extra Paws. The
Friends number can also be affect based on mutual engagement. To elaborate, if you actively engage with someone else's
content, and that same user also actively engages with your content, that will affect the Friends number.
