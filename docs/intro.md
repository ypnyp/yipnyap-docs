Yipnyap is a place for fandoms and communities to come together and show off, create, and make new friend groups, or
extend their current.

**This documentation site is still being worked on!**

## A better way to socialise
Fandom-centric sites share common issues: It's an Outdated UI, there's little to no moderation, missing the most
important and helpful features, and their focus aren't always users.

Another issue that we feel is important are the different norms and cultures of each individual country and region,
this is something that not many platforms acknowledge. We want to bring everyone together while keeping everyone's
culture in mind. This means everything we do is based on statistics, not our personal beliefs and bias.

So, Yipnyap was born! Yipnyap is a place where you create groups about whatever you want, and post your ideas, stories,
make a poll, and share your images. With the Post Designer Toolkit, you can make your own metapost, from quizzes to
full on wiki entries! Yipnyap is designed with everyone in mind, backed by constant research and feedback.

## What next?
We have 2 more things to do: Beta Testing and Research.

### Beta test
Yipnyap is basically almost ready for *actual* testing, but there’s a ton of bugs so here’s the deal: it’s gonna be
invite only so I can get rid of those bugs, improve security, and add improvements that users want the most in a fandom
platform. If you would like to participate and don’t yet have an account, LMK! If you know anyone who would also like
to participate, feel free to send them my Discord ID (rek#0001) or HMU on [Telegram](https://t.me/rekkisomo)!

If you already have an account, you’re already in! Creating one from here on out until the site is updated to Beta 1
(currently Alpha 9) will have your account temporarily suspended until you enter a valid invite code, otherwise it’ll
be deleted.

### Research
During the beta, we'll periodically unobtrusively ask those using Yipnyap questions about their experience, and gain
feedback and criticism.
