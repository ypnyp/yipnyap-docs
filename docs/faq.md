## How do the Invite Codes work?
Invite Codes are completely unique, and can only be used once. When someone joins via an Invite Code, the person who
made it gets notified, as well as auto added as a mutual friend on both accounts. A user can only make 20 codes a month,
but this may be raised in the future!

## Where do I get an Invite Code?
You can fetch an Invite Code through someone who already has a valid Yipnyap Account and doesn't have any warnings.
Tell them to go into `Settings > Teams`, or search for `Invite code` via the search box on the top right of Yipnyap.

### ... but when i contacted support, they asked me to generate an invite code. what???
We request an Invite Code so we can post on your behalf and avoid Kukiko, or fix a deeper issue.

When generating, ensure you've check the box that says `Generate a one-time use code that grants "write to account"`,
then `Support Request ID`, then type in the Unique ID you received from support.

This lets the support member act on your behalf **only once**. After the code is used, it gets deleted and cannot be
used again. It does not count towards your monthly quota :)

This can only be used by staff, so for example if someone asks you to create a code, you won't be able to without a
Support Request ID. If you have any questions with this process, ask your support agent to explain more on what's going
to happen!

## Kukiko says my post is toxic. What gives?
To help with moderation, Kukiko will automatically reject posts if it finds that your post is too toxic and may break
our rules. If something isn't right, please contact us with the post you're trying to make!

### ... but i'm trying to post something R18
Although Kukiko's sensitivity is lowered on R18 marked accounts, its not uncommon that it still rejects posts. You'll
have to contact us for more information, like why it thinks its toxic, or if it's a false positive.
