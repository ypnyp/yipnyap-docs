## Short answer: yes, with limits.
We decided to partially block R18 as we don't want Yipnyap as a hub for NSFW content. We want it to be usable by
everyone, so this means that we have to come up with another method for NSFW content exist. Minors are allowed to use
this Platform, and on top of that, it's hard to moderate NSFW content to ensure it follows the laws in the region the
data is stored. (London, UK).

### So we made a better solution, marking your account!
Marking your account as "NSFW" will restrict your account from showing in the public explore, as well as picks in "Your
Mix", however they will show to users that follow you, or users that follow someone who is also marked as NSFW and
repaws your content.

## I want to make an online shop on Yipnyap Scalebite that contains R18 artwork, what are my options?
Unfortunately, Scalebite will not support R18 content in the near future.

## What is classified as "R18"?
Content considered R18 are usually sexually explicit, extremely violent or inappropriate. Statistically, we know that
exposure to this type of content could also be psychologically damaging to some people, especially if under the age of
18.

If you are caught posting R18 Content, your account was not marked, and had some warnings prior, you will have this
badge on your profile for 14 days while we investigate further, unless appealed earlier.

## My account got banned because of "...", why?
Here's a list of the bans related to sexual content could happen, what they mean, and if you can appeal.

### Sexual Content: Minor
You've been banned for posting too much suggestive content while being unmarked. Ability
to be appealed depends on the situation.

### Sexual Content: Major
You've been banned for posting pornography while unmarked, even after a warning. Users
will only get 3 warnings to mark their account unless we're notified that it's an error.

### Hardcore Pornography
You've posted content depicting a child in a sexual or suggestive manner, extreme gore, death, grossly offensive,
non-consensual, or if the content in question is depicting an act which threatens a person's life, an act which results,
or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals, an act which involves sexual
interference with a human corpse, or a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal
(whether dead or alive).

### When we contact law enforcement
If you openly admit that you are a pedophile or a zoophile, you will be banned, however your profile content will
persist for law enforcement officers to investigate until a conclusion is made.
